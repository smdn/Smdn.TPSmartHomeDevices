[Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo](./src/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo/) and [Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Kasa](./src/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Kasa/) are class libraries that provide .NET APIs for operating Tapo and Kasa smart home devices.

These class libraries provide device classes such as `L530` (`Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo` namespace) and `KL130` (`Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Kasa` namespace), which have the same name as the device's product model name.

These device classes perform operations by communicating directly with Tapo/Kasa devices in the same network. Remote operation via the Internet is not supported.

```csharp
using Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo;

// Creates device object for L530 multicolor light bulb
using var bulb = new L530(
  "192.0.2.1",      // IP address currently assigned to the device
  "user@mail.test", // E-mail address for your Tapo account
  "password"        // Password for your Tapo account
);

// Sets the color temperature and brightness.
// In the off state, the bulb will automatically turn on.
await bulb.SetColorTemperatureAsync(colorTemperature: 5500, brightness: 80);
```

### Supported device and functions

- Raspbian GNU/Linux 9.13 (stretch); Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+


### More library features
The device class such as `L530` does not simply provide methods to wrap the sending of requests to the device. `Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo` and `Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Kasa` also provides the following features.

The following example illustrates the basic API usage as well as what happens in the background of a method.

```csharp
using Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo;

// Creates client for L530 multicolor light bulb
using var bulb = new L530("192.0.2.1", "user@mail.test", "password");

// Turn on the bulb, and set the color temperature and brightness.
await bulb.SetColorTemperatureAsync(colorTemperature: 5500, brightness: 80);
//    Here, connections and sessions are established automatically.
//    Also attempts retry automatically when recoverable errors
//    such as device busy or timeout occur.

// Suppose a few minutes, hours or days passes here.
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromHours(...));

// Then, sets the color and brightness of the bulb.
await bulb.SetColorTemperatureAsync(colorTemperature: 4000, brightness: 40);
//    At this time, if the connection or session has expired,
//    it will attempt to reconnect/re-authenticate automatically.
//    Also, if the connection is established using a MAC address and
//    the resolved endpoint is unreachable, it will attempt to
//    resolve it again. (requires Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.MacAddressEndPoint)
```

#### Automated session management
Connection and authentication to the device is performed automatically when a request is sent to the device. Reconnection and reauthentication is also performed automatically when an exception occurs or when a session expires.

#### Built-in and customizable retry and error handling
Built-in error handling is provided by default for typical errors such as device busy, session expired, or request timeout. Customized error handling is also available, allowing you to define handling for each type of exception and retries. See [Tapo example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo/CustomExceptionHandling/) and [Kasa example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Kasa/CustomExceptionHandling/).

#### Supports default protocol (`securePassthrough`) and new protocol (`KLAP`)
`Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo` version 2.0.0 or later supports the new protocol `KLAP` for Tapo devices. By default, the appropriate protocol is automatically selected. You can also explicitly specify a protocol. See [this example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo/SelectProtocol/).

#### Addressing devices using MAC addresses
Supports specifying device endpoint by MAC address. This is useful in networks with variable IP addresses, such as networks using DHCP. This feature requires an extension library [Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.MacAddressEndPoint](#smdntpsmarthomedevicesmacaddressendpoint).

#### Other features
- Supports dependency injection (`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`)
  - Logging (`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`) - [Tapo example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo/Logging/), [Kasa example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Kasa/Logging/)
  - HTTP (`Microsoft.Extensions.Http`) - [example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo/ConfigureTimeout/)
- Providing Tapo credentials via environment variables - [example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo/CredentialsEnvVar/)
- Customizable Tapo credential provider - [example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo/Credentials/)
- Configuring timeout and cancellation - [Tapo example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo/ConfigureTimeout/), [Kasa example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Kasa/ConfigureTimeout/)

### Recommended usage on Tapo devices
Tapo devices have introduced secure authentication methods in new firmware released after summer 2023. If new firmware is installed, hashed credentials can be used for authentication. This means that it is no longer necessary to embed the username and password in plain text.

Additionally, Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo can retrieve hashed credentials from environment variables.

The following code shows an example of retrieving hashed credential from the `TAPO_KLAP_LOCALAUTHHASH` environment variable and using it when authenticating to a Tapo device.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

using Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo;
using Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo.Credentials;
using Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo.Protocol;

var services = new ServiceCollection();

// Specifies that the device should be operated using the newer protocol.
services.AddTapoProtocolSelector(TapoSessionProtocol.Klap);

// Specifies the environment variable in which the hashed credential
// used for authentication is set.
services.AddTapoBase64EncodedKlapCredentialFromEnvironmentVariable(
  envVarBase64KlapLocalAuthHash: "TAPO_KLAP_LOCALAUTHHASH"
);

using var plug = new P105("192.0.2.1", services.BuildServiceProvider());

await plug.TurnOnAsync();
```

The environment variable `TAPO_KLAP_LOCALAUTHHASH` has to be a BASE64 string calculated by the formula `BASE64(SHA256(SHA1(username) + SHA1(password)))`. See [this example](./examples/Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo/CredentialsEnvVar/) for detail.

> [!NOTE]
> Although `Smdn.TPSmartHomeDevices.Tapo` still supports devices with older protocol/firmware, it is recommended that you update your Tapo device's firmware to the latest version before using the library.
